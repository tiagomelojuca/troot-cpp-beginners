# troot-cpp-beginners

Repo created for store all exercises done over [Modern C++ for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-cpp-moderno-para-iniciantes/) from TerminalRoot.

Please note that all exercises are very simple. This course was done just to complement some important topics not covered by another course (referred in [this repo](https://github.com/tiagomelojuca/cod3r-cpp-essential/)), also for beginners. Both were done aiming the same job interview, the one referred in the another repo.
